# jigglypuffing
A place of jiggling, puffing and hypnosleep.

Created by Rosie Burkett, Steve Torrens and Engie Matene from EDA Kokako-2018 cohort.
In Week 7 of Bootcamp our cohort were taught Authentication using JWT Token.

This Jigglypuffing project was a simple fun 1 day project we created from scratch to practice using Authentication we were just taught.
This project was created using React, Redux and JWT Token.

I also continue to use this project for learning new technologies.

Current learning (to adapt the project to): 

1. PHP
2. SilverStripe
3. Ruby

(The skills will continue to be added too).
