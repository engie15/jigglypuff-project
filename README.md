# jigglypuffing
A place of jiggling, puffing and hypnosleep.

Created by Rosie Burkett, Steve Torrens and Engie Matene from EDA Kokako-2018 cohort.
In Week 7 of Bootcamp our cohort were taught Authentication using JWT Token.
This Jigglypuffing project was a simple 1 day project we created from scratch to practice using Authentication we were just taught.

A fun 1 day project applying the a new skill we had just learnt.

We hope you enjoy!
